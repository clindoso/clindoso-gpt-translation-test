description: Learn about the different *cmd* parameters which are needed to generate reports automatically using the JobManager.
---

To create the reports available in the user interface with JobManager, you must configure the **cmd** parameter.

Example: `cmd=shiftplan`

Some reports allow you to change the report output by adding additional text:

- showconsel=1 (Show Contracts And Selections)
- hidefda=1 (Hide Full Day Activities)
- showbreaks=1 (Show Breaks)

Example: `cmd=shiftplan showconsel=1`

The tables below display all the required value for reports that are available under _WFM > Monitoring > Reports_{:.breadcrumbs}.
