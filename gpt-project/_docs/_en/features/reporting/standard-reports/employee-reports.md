## Employee work schedules

Employee Work Schedules can be used to create work schedules and be sent to your employees.
They show the daily working time of the employees and their paid and unpaid activities and shifts.

- **Employee Work Schedule I (List)**  
   All activity types except `Illness` and all shifts. Displays only days with scheduling data.

- **Employee Work Schedule I (List) (without Breaks)**  
   All activity types except `Break` and `Illness` and all shifts. Displays only days with scheduling data.

- **Employee Work Schedule II (List)**  
   All activity types and all shifts. Displays also days without scheduling data.

- **Employee Work Schedule III (Graph)**
  Diagram version of the schedule with colored bars in a time scale per day. All activity types and shifts.

- **Employee Work Schedule IV (6 Weeks)**  
   Displays all activity types and shifts and the working hours per day. Shows individual activities of shifts but not the name of the shift.

- **Employee Work Schedule IV (6 weeks) (Activities)**  
   In contrast to the previous report, the last 4 weeks of the report period (report weeks 3 to 6) contain all concrete activities of the type `Presence`, and only as many weeks are displayed as are selected in the report period (up to a maximum of 6 weeks).

- **Employee Work Schedule (6 weeks) (no Breaks)**  
   Uses all activity types except `Break` and shows the shifts and the daily working time.

## Hours worked per employee

- **Hours Worked per Employee I**  
   Target work time, actual time worked and the difference in hours and the percentage of the target work time that has been worked.

- **Hours Worked per Employee II**  
   Adjusted target working hours, the actual working hours and the difference in hours and in percent. The report does not contain monthly values. <!-- AnpassungszeitrÃ¤ume are used --> The annual working time is determined from the working times defined in the contract.
    <!-- This annual working time is then distributed to the planning periods by the function for adjustment periods as target time. However, these planning periods have different weightings so that there is no distribution 'x/52'.  -->
    <!-- If these planning periods are in the past and you have already worked with them, the corresponding columns in the report are filled. --> If the planning periods are still in the future, only the adjusted target time is displayed.
