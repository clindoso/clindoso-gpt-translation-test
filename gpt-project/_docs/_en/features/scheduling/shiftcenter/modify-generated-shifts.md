## Modify the shifts created by the shift generation process

In {% link_new shift bidding | features/scheduling/shift-bidding.md %}, the shift generation creates shifts based on the day models specified in the shift requirement table and based on existing employee requirements. In the Shift Center, you can check the shifts which have been created by the shift generation per day and overwrite them if necessary:

1. In the parameter window, click the **Day Models** tab and right-click a cell.
2. Click **Edit Shift Requirement...**. A list of all day models appears.
3. Click the {% icon plus %} to the left of a day model to expand it. For each shift of a day model, the number of generated shifts is shown in the _Requirement_ column to the right.

4. Check existing values or update them. To update them, click a cell in the _Requirement_ column next to a shift and enter a new value.
5. Click _OK_{:.doc-button} to save your changes.
