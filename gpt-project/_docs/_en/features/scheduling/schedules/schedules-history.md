In this article, you will learn how to view and restore changes to the schedule.

## Display and restore schedule changes

_Plan > Schedules_{:.breadcrumbs} allows you to view and restore past changes you or other planners have made to the schedule. The Schedules feature shows you what was changed, when it was changed and who made the changes.

You can restore a schedule change for a single employee for a single day:

1. Go to _Plan > Schedules_{:.breadcrumbs}.
2. Click the **arrow** icon on the left to expand a **Planning unit**.
3. Double-click a **day cell** of an employee.
4. Click the **History** tab on the left. A table with the past schedule changes for the employee appears for the chosen day.

   <br>On top, you can see the current shift of the employee. Below, you will find the previous versions of the shift on that day in descending time order. The table consists of four columns:

   - _Name_: the name of the person who changed the employee's shift
   - _Date & Time_: the date and time when the shift was changed
   - _Action_: a short description about what has changed; in some cases, internal systems create entries which appear as _Unknown_ here
   - _Time scale_ column: the specific activities of the shift

5. Click a **row in the table** to select the changes you want to restore. You cannot restore rows with activities which have already been deleted.
6. Click _Save_{:.doc-button} to restore the selected state. Click _Cancel_{:.doc-button} to return to the _Schedules_ feature.
