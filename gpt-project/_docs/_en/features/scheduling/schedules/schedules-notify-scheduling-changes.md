In _Plan > Schedules_{:.breadcrumbs}, you can notify people about their schedule. You can send push notifications or emails to your people, for example if you made changes to their schedule.

## Communicate schedule changes

Use this function for any {% link_new scheduling period | features/scheduling/schedules/scheduling-periods/what-are-scheduling-periods.md %} set to status _Information_.

1. Click _Notify people_{:.doc-button}.
2. Select the **Planning unit** for which you want to send schedule changes to employees.
3. Select the **Date range**.
4. Select the **People** you would like to notify.
5. Click _Notify people_{:.doc-button}.

### Email and browser push notifications

When you notify people, they will receive push notifications or emails, even if you did not make any changes to the schedule. People will only be notified about the date range you have selected, but not about specific activity changes.

Your people need to allow {% link_new browser push notifications | getting-started/notifications.md %} in their browsers.

By default, both email and browser push notifications are allowed. To turn off email or browser push notifications for your tenant, go to _Account > Notifications_{:.breadcrumbs}.
