In the Meeting Planner, you can schedule meetings and assign them to people.

> This article is about _WFM > Scheduling > SchedulePro > Meeting Planner_{:.breadcrumbs}.
>
> If you are using injixo Advanced WFM or Enterprise WFM, use the {% link_new Meetings | features/scheduling/meetings/meetings-overview.md %} feature under _Plan > Meetings_{:.breadcrumbs} instead.

Using the meeting parameters that you define and the people you select, injixo will display possible meeting times containing a certain activity. Select one or more of the meeting time suggestions and insert the meeting information in the _Schedule_ level of the _Shift Center_{:.menu-item}.

The program tries to find potential meeting times that match the parameters you enter. To reflect the two different search criteria, the program window is divided into two parts: the Meeting Parameters and Employees sections.

> Note
>
> Only Employees who are already scheduled for the period for which you want to schedule a meeting will be included in the search.

## Setting meeting parameters

First, set the required parameters in the Meeting Parameters section.

| Search Daily                  | Check this checkbox if you want the entered start and end times to count as possible start and end times for each day within the search period. Note that this checkbox only changes the behavior for periods longer than one day. If this checkbox is checked, the system verifies whether a meeting can take place each day between the specified start and end times. For example, if you enter Monday to Friday from 09:00 to 17:00, the result can only be a meeting within that time frame, for example, Tuesday 11:00. However, if this checkbox is not checked, the system checks whether a meeting can take place at any time between 9:00 a.m. on Monday and 5:00 p.m. on Friday. This would mean that a meeting on Tuesday at 07:00 is possible. If the checkbox is checked, alternative start and end dates for the meeting can also be specified. |
| Start Time                    | Enter a desired time for the start of the period during which the meeting is to take place. The default time is 00:00.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Scheduling meetings

| Column              | Description                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Date                | Displays the date for each suggested meeting time.                                                                                                  |
| Start Time          | Displays the start time for each suggested meeting time.                                                                                            |
| Affected Activities | Displays all the activities where coverage would be affected by scheduling this meeting.                                                            |
| Coverage            | This column displays the number of Employees by which the coverage of the affected activity would be reduced if the suggested meeting is scheduled. |

Click the _Schedule_{:.doc-button} in the column `Scheduling Selection` for each meeting suggestion that you want to schedule. The meeting will then be transferred to the `Schedule` level of the _Shift Center_{:.menu-item} and assigned to the relevant Employees. When the process is complete, an information message advising the successful scheduling of the meeting is displayed. The _Schedule_{:.doc-button} is not available for suggested meeting times that violate existing scheduling rules, and therefore cannot be scheduled.

You can view the results of scheduling meetings in the `Schedule` level of the _Shift Center_{:.menu-item}. For every Employee who has been assigned a meeting, the comments entered are displayed along with information about the meeting in the `Comment` tab of the entry dialog in _Shift Center_{:.menu-item}.
