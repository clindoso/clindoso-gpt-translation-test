In _Intraday > Intraday Adherence_{:.breadcrumbs}, you can compare people's scheduled activities with the actual activities to identify historical out-of-adherence periods throughout the day. Intraday adherence uses {% link_new real-time adherence | features/intraday/real-time-adherence.md %} data from your ACD. You can access the adherence data for the current month and the last six months.

## Prerequisites

To see adherence data, make sure the following applies:
- You have added an {% link_new integration | features/acd-integration/cloud/how-integrations-work.md %} that supports agent status data import.
- You have set up the {% link_new agent status data import | features/acd-integration/cloud/import-agent-status-data.md %}.

## Display data

To display adherence data for a specific day, follow these steps:

1. Select a **Planning unit** and/or a **Selection**.
2. At the top of the page, select a date by using the date picker, or click _Today_{:.doc-button} or _Yesterday_{:.doc-button}.

The page displays the total adherence score, adherence scores by interval, and a table with the details of the adherence data per person for the selected day.

### Adherence score

The page shows different adherence score details:

- **Adherence**: Percentage of working time spent on scheduled activities. If the day has not ended, the score is calculated up to the last updated timestamp, which is displayed above the score. If the score falls below the {% link_new the target adherence score | features/intraday/real-time-adherence.md | #define-the-target-adherence-score %}, it is highlighted in red.
- **Scores by interval**: Vertical blue bars represent scores by interval. Scores lower than 100&nbsp;% represent intervals during which peopleâ€™s actual activities deviate from their scheduled activities.
- **Target adherence score**: The dashed line in the graph shows the configured target score.

<!-- Adherence in %	Percentage of working time spent in activities that comply with the scheduled activities	Minutes in adherence/scheduled minutes * 100% -->

### Staff overview table

Under the total adherence score and the scores by interval, a table displays adherence details for the selected day. To sort the table by adherence score, click the **Adherence** header. To sort the table by name, click the **Name** header. See {% link_new filtering and sorting | features/intraday/real-time-adherence.md | #search-and-filter %}.
Each row shows a person's adherence score. Differences between the person's scheduled activities and their actual activities are highlighted. 

When a person's score drops below the configured adherence target score, their score is highlighted in red. {% link_new Matches | features/intraday/adherence-matches.md %} and {% link_new buffer times | features/intraday/real-time-adherence.md | #buffer-time %} may influence changes in status and adherence types. Learn more about the {% link_new status and types | features/intraday/real-time-adherence.md | #status %}.

Different colors identify the three out-of-adherence types:

- Red: Not present
- Yellow: Wrong activity
- Blue: Not scheduled

## Agent intraday adherence

To see the details of a person's intraday adherence in a new window, click their row. To change dates, use the month selector or the navigation arrows next to the dates.

On the left, two boxes display an overview of the selected month:

- **Person name**: Shows the person's adherence score, how long they were scheduled, and adherence details for the selected month. The values include the data up to the last completed interval of the current day.
- **Daily overview**: Days for which adherence scores are available are highlighted in red. Hover over a date to see the adherence score of the selected person. Click a date to see the details.

On the right, you can see in detail when this person was scheduled and where they did not adhere to the schedule:

- **Intraday adherence score**: Calculated using data up to the last completed interval of the current day. Identical to the day score when you hover a date in **Daily overview**.
- **Scheduled** and **Out of Adherence** durations: Sum of durations for all scheduled activities (activity types Present, Meeting, Break) and deviations in the schedule on the selected date.
- **Timeline**: Colored bars highlight scheduled activities, actual activities, and out-of-adherence statuses. In the **Out of adherence** row, you can click out-of-adherence time slots to zoom in. Click _Reset zoom_{:.doc-button} to reset the zoom.
- **Table**: Each row shows details for out-of-adherence periods. Click a header to sort data by time period, actual activity, status, scheduled activity or out of adherence duration.

## Adherence report (CSV file)

If you need to analyze adherence and conformance data for individual people over a longer time frame, e.g. to calculate bonus payments, you can download a report as a CSV file that includes aggregated adherence and conformance data. To download the Adherence report file , follow these steps:

1. Select a **Planning unit** and/or a **Selection**.
2. Click _Download report_{:.doc-button}.  
3. In the **Download report** window, select a date range for the report. You can select any date range from one day to up to six months in the past.
4. Click _Download report_{:.doc-button}.

The table below explains the report columns:
