If the shift swap functionality has been activated by a user with Admin access, you can swap shifts with colleagues who have skills, availability, and working hours that match your shift and contract.

Here is an overview of the shift swap process:

1. You offer one of your shifts.
2. (Optional) You select shifts that you would like to swap your shift with. You send email invitations to your colleagues.
3. Your colleagues place counteroffers on your offered shift.
4. You accept one of the counteroffers.
5. (Optional) Your planner approves the swap.

If your organization is on the Essential WFM plan, you will not be able to send email invitations to your colleagues (step 2).

## Swap shifts

### Offer a shift

1. Go to _Me > My Calendar_{:.breadcrumbs} or to _Me > Dashboard_{:.breadcrumbs}.
2. In **My Calendar**, click _Day_{:.doc-button} to switch to the daily view.
3. In the section **7 Day Agenda**, click the offer icon _![Offer Button](/assets/img/common/injixo-me/offer.png)_{:.doc-button-icon} next to the shift you want to offer. The offer icon is visible if {% link_new shift swaps | features/scheduling/schedules/scheduling-periods/schedules-enable-employees-to-swap-shifts.md %} are allowed for this period and shift.
   A dialog window opens.
4. Click _Swap_{:.doc-button}.  
   A drop-down menu opens where you can select one or multiple days that you would like to swap your shift on.
5. Click _Swap_{:.doc-button}.
6. (Optional) To send a notification to all colleagues of the selected shift(s), click _Send invitation(s)_{:.doc-button}. You may also see entries for people who are not scheduled for a shift on the day or who are scheduled for a full-day activity. Click _Skip invitation(s)_{:.doc-button} to not send notifications.

   > Note
   >
   > The page to send notifications will not be displayed if your planner has not activated email notifications for Me.

7. (Optional) To leave a comment, click the {% icon message %} next to the offered shift.
8. Click _Close_{:.doc-button}.

The icon next to the offered shift turns green in your overview. Your colleagues will see your offer in the **7 Day Agenda** section and can place a counteroffer.

### Place a counteroffer

To place a counteroffer for an offered shift, you can offer your own shift:

1. Go to _Me > My Calendar_{:.breadcrumbs}.
2. Click _Day_{:.doc-button} to switch to the daily view.
3. In the **7 Day Agenda** section, click the counteroffer icon _![Button Counteroffer](/assets/img/common/injixo-me/counter-offer.png)_{:.doc-button-icon} next to the shift that you want to offer.
4. Under **Other Shifts**, click _Offer_{:.doc-button} to offer your shift as a counteroffer.
   The employee who offered the shift will be informed about your counteroffer.
5. Click _Close_{:.doc-button}.

### Accept a counteroffer

If you offered a shift and received a counteroffer, you will see a **Shift Offer Received** notification in _Me > Dashboard_{:.breadcrumbs}. To accept the counteroffer, proceed as follows:

1. Go to _Me > Dashboard_{:.breadcrumbs}.
2. In the **Notices** section, click _View_{:.doc-button} next to the **Shift Offer Received** notification.  
   A dialog window opens.
3. Under **Shift Offers**, click _Accept_{:.doc-button}.  
   If you need planner approval for the swap, a yellow banner shows the following message: This shift swap is pending approval. The counteroffer icon _![Available Shifts To Swap Button](/assets/img/common/injixo-me/counter-offer.png)_{:.doc-button-icon} turns yellow.
4. Click _Close_{:.doc-button}.

### Reject a counteroffer

To reject a counteroffer and cancel a shift swap, proceed as follows:

1. Go to _Me > Dashboard_{:.breadcrumbs}.
2. In the **Notices** section, click _View_{:.doc-button} next to the **Shift Offer Received** notification.  
   A dialog window opens.
3. Under **Your Shifts**, click _Retain_{:.doc-button}.
4. Click _Close_{:.doc-button}.

### Cancel a shift offer

1. Go to _Me > Dashboard_{:.breadcrumbs}.
2. In the **7 Day Agenda** section, click the green offer icon _![Offer Button](/assets/img/common/injixo-me/offer.png)_{:.doc-button-icon} next to an offered shift.  
   A dialog window opens.
3. Under **Your Shifts**, click _Retain_{:.doc-button}.
4. Click _Close_{:.doc-button}.  
   The offer icon next to your shift turns grey.

## Why can't I see anyone to swap shifts with?

There are several reasons why you can't see a list of available shifts:

- You or your colleague do not have all the skills required to work on the shift you want to swap.
- You or your colleague would violate working time regulations by swapping shifts.
- You and your colleague do not work in the same team and you are not allowed to swap shifts across teams.

If you need help swapping shifts, get in touch with your supervisor or planner.
