Time off represents absences from the workplace. The amount and types of time off that you can take will depend on your organization's regulations and on your contract.

Go to _Me > Time Off_{:.breadcrumbs} to:
- Request time off
- See the time-off types available to you (e.g. illness)
- Check your remaining time-off balance
- Manage existing time-off requests

In the calendar, you can see on which days you are scheduled to work, and on which days you have planned time off (in green) or requested time off (in dark gray).

## My time-off balance

1. Select a time-off type from the drop-down in the top left corner.
2. The sections **Pending**, **Remaining** and **Taken** show the current status for the selected time-off type.  
  **Pending**: time off you have requested that has not yet been approved or rejected.  
  **Remaining**: time off that is still available to be requested.  
  **Taken**: time off that you have already requested and that has been approved.

## Request time off for full days

1. Select a time-off type from the drop-down in the top left corner.
2. Click _+ Request time off_{:.doc-button}.
3. Select a **Start Date** and an **End Date**.
4. (Optional) Enter a comment.
5. Click _Request time-off_{:.doc-button}.

To cancel your pending time-off request, click the {% icon trash %}.
You cannot edit a time-off request. If you need to edit information, delete the time-off request and create a new one.

## Request time off for part days

1. Select a time-off type from the drop-down in the top left corner.
2. Click _+ Request time off_{:.doc-button}.
3. Select a **Start Date** and an **End Date** that fall on the same day or on two consecutive days.
4. Activate the **Request a part of the day** option.
5. Enter a **Start Time** and an **End Time**.
6. (Optional) Enter a comment.
7. Click _Request time-off_{:.doc-button}.

To cancel your pending time-off request, click the {% icon trash %}.
You cannot edit a time-off request. If you need to edit information, delete the time-off request and create a new one.

## Cancel an approved time-off request

You cannot cancel an approved time-off request on your own. Instead, you have to request a cancellation that your planner or team lead can approve or reject.

1. In the **Time-off requests** section, click the {% icon circle_xmark %} under the approved request you want to cancel.
2. (Optional) Enter a **Reason for cancellation**.
3. Click _Request cancellation_{:.doc-button}.

To withdraw a cancellation request for an already approved time off, click the {% icon rotate_left %}.
