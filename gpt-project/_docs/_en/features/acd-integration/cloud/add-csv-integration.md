## What is a CSV integration?

A CSV integration imports historical contact or agent status data from CSV files. Use a CSV integration if your system can't connect with any other integration.

Here is an overview of the process of the CSV integration:

- Create a CSV integration in injixo
- Create a CSV schema
- Map the columns (via drop-down menu or SQL query)
- Automatic or manual import of CSV files

## Add a CSV integration

To import different CSV file formats (e.g. with different separators, date formats, or column names), set up a separate integration for each. Depending on the CSV file your external system generates, injixo might expect different columns than those of your CSV. [Learn more](#map-the-columns) about the columns expected by injixo and how to map them if your CSV file contains different columns or column names.

To add a CSV integration in injixo, proceed as follows:

1. Go to _Account > Integrations_{:.breadcrumbs}.
2. If there already is an integration, click _Add integration_{:.doc-button}.
3. In the **Universal Interfaces** tile, click _Select model_{:.doc-button}.
4. In the **CSV** section, click _Add integration_{:.doc-button}.

## Configure a new CSV integration

1. Enter a unique name for the integration that identifies the data source.
2. In the **injixo Cloud Link** section, install {% link_new injixo Cloud Link | features/acd-integration/cloud/install-cloud-link.md | #install-injixo-cloud-link %} and connect it. If you prefer to [upload the data manually](#manual-file-import), you can skip this step.
3. In the **CSV schema configuration** section, select the **Type of import data**:
   - **Contact data**: The uploaded data includes all offered and handled volumes recorded by your external system, such as calls, chats, social media, tickets, emails, or documents.
   - **Agent status**: The uploaded data includes all agent activities recorded by your external system, such as login, logout, on call, after-call work, break, ready, etc.
4. Click _Create a new CSV schema_{:.doc-button}.
5. Configure the CSV schema settings. This includes:
   - Setup and preprocessing options
   - Column mapping (per default via [drop-down menus](#map-the-columns); alternatively via [SQL query](#map-the-columns-sql-query))  
      Learn more about how to [create a CSV schema](#create-a-csv-schema) including the above configuration options.
6. Click _Save integration_{:.doc-button} to create the integration.

After saving the integration, you can use the [manual data import](#manual-file-import) or set up the [automatic data import](#automatic-file-import).

## Create a CSV schema

Each CSV integration has its own CSV schema. The CSV schema describes the CSV file formatting and column mapping. If your external system generates a CSV file that does not provide the exact column names shown in injixo, you can map them in injixo using the [drop-down menus (default)](#map-the-columns) or an [SQL query](#map-the-columns-sql-query).  
[Learn more](#map-the-columns) about the columns expected by injixo and how to map them if your CSV file contains different columns or column names.

Before you can create a CSV schema, you need to [add a CSV integration](#add-a-csv-integration) and select the type of import data. The parameters you configure for the CSV schema will differ depending on the type of import data selected (contact data or agent status).

### Setup and preprocessing options

1. In the **Setup** section, upload a sample CSV file generated by your external system. This allows you to see how injixo will handle your system's files during import.
2. Configure the following parameters. Depending on the type of import data, the parameters will differ:<br><br>

   | **Layout of data**<br>(Contact data only)                     | The data layout depends on how your CSV file was generated:<br>**Contact-based**: For contact details records that contain one line for every single contact. Because imported contact-based data is aggregated into 15-minute intervals, the interval of the planning unit must be 15 minutes. New data imports will overwrite the data that has been previously imported for the interval. If your file contains the same timestamp multiple times, this data will be added up for the interval.<br><br>**Interval-based**: For aggregated data that contains one line with all contact information per interval. Additionally, select the correct interval length that matches that of your CSV file. If you select an interval that is larger than the intervals of the uploaded files, you will see an error. If you do it the other way around, i.e. selecting a 15-minute interval for a file with larger intervals (e.g. 30 minutes), every missing (here: every second) interval will be filled with a 0 or the text no data, depending on what you configured in the **Handle missing values in intervals** option. |
   | **Handle missing values in intervals**<br>(Contact data only) | Define how missing values in the target queue will be displayed in other places in injixo:<br>**Fill with zero**: Missing values will be replaced by a zero.<br>**Leave empty**: Missing values will be replaced by the text: no data.<br>**Leave empty** fits most scenarios. Imports will overwrite already existing data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

3. (Optional) In the **Preprocessing options** section, select one or more options that apply to your CSV file format:<br><br>

   | Preprocessing option       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                             |
   | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Add header row**         | For files without a header row, injixo will label the columns with A, B, C, etc. on the [column mapping](#map-the-columns) page.                                                                        |
   | **Skip empty rows**        | injixo will ignore lines that only contain separators.                                                                                                                                                  |
   | **Skip first rows**        | injixo will remove additional lines at the beginning of the file. Enter the number of rows to be ignored.                                                                                               |
   | **Skip row(s) containing** | injixo will ignore lines with certain characters. Enter a string (case-sensitive). injixo will ignore rows containing this string. You can add multiple strings by clicking _Add string_{:.doc-button}. |

4. To proceed with the column mapping, click _Map the columns_{:.doc-button}.

### Map the columns

By default, you can use the drop-down menus in the **Map columns** section to define how the columns of your CSV files will be matched with the columns required by injixo. Before you can map columns, you need to complete the [setup](#setup-and-preprocessing-options).
If your external system generates CSV files that do not provide the expected columns, you can [map them using an SQL query](#map-the-columns-sql-query).

The mapping page shows a preview of your uploaded CSV file.

1. Using the drop-down menus, map the columns and formats of the CSV file.

2. Fill in each field.  
   Learn more about the options for [Contact data](#contact-data-drop-down-menus) and [Agent status](#agent-status-drop-down-menus) data in the tables below.

3. To save your configuration, click _Save schema_{:.doc-button}.

#### Contact data drop-down menus

If you have selected **Contact data** as the type of import data, the default mapping page displays the following elements:

| Field          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Required for interval-based data | Required for contact-based data |

Note: While not technically required, importing AHT for interval-based data is crucial for precise staff requirement calculations and forecasting.

#### Agent status drop-down menus

If you have selected **Agent status** as the type of import data, the default mapping page displays the following elements:

| Field                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Required |

#### Custom date format

You can configure a custom date format that matches the date in your CSV files. Add the following characters to the **Custom date format** input field:

- for the day: **D** (single-digits 1-9) or **DD** (for leading zeros)
- for the month: **M** (single-digits 1-9) or **MM** (for leading zeros)
- for the year: **YY** or **YYYY**

All other characters are interpreted as separators.

Examples:

| Date     | Custom date format |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| 13/1,22  | D/M,YY             |
| 010122   | DDMMYY             |
| 13012022 | DDMMYYYY           |

#### Custom timestamp format with date and time

To add a custom timestamp format, activate the **Date and time in one column** option.
In addition to the [custom date format](#custom-date-format), you must set the time format using lowercase letters:

- for hours: **h** (single-digits 1-9) or **hh** (for leading zeros)
- for minutes: **m** (single-digits 1-9) or **mm** (for leading zeros)
- (optional) for seconds: **s** (single-digits 1-9) or **ss** (for leading zeros)

Examples:

| Date and time  | Timestamp format |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| 13/1,22 9:15:8 | D/M,YY h:m:s     |
| 010122 09-15   | DDMMYY hh-mm     |

### Map the columns (SQL query)

For most CSV files, you can use the default mapping via the drop-down menus. If your external system generates CSV files that do not contain certain columns required by the default mapping form (e.g. if they require additional calculations) or if they contain unsupported formats, the [default mapping method](#map-the-columns) may not work for you. In this case, you can map the columns using an SQL query (SQLite). This allows you to convert total values into averages or calculate a call volume from multiple columns, for example. This mapping method is only available for contact data. It cannot be used for agent status data.

#### Requirements

Consider the following requirements for writing an SQL query for column mapping:

- Use `uploaded_file` as table name.
- Use lowercase for column names.
- Use datetime as data type for the timestamp column (formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss`).
- Use the [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) query syntax.

The [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) SQL query supports mathematical operations, data conversions, and column aliases (to map different column names). You can find out more about the limitations regarding the following items on sqlite.org:

- [numeric precision](https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html)
- [math functions](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_mathfunc.html)
- [implicit data conversions](https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#affinity)
- [date and time functions](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html)
- [string manipulation](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html#string_functions)

To map the columns via SQL query, proceed as follows:

> Changing the mapping method will overwrite an existing CSV schema
>
> If you have already created a CSV schema, changing the mapping method and saving the new schema will overwrite the previous one. You cannot restore a CSV schema once it's overwritten.

1. Activate the **Use SQL query to map columns** toggle in the upper right of the column mapping page.
2. Enter an SQL query (SQLite) into the text field. Tip: Copy and paste the sample queries below according to your needs.

If you want to upload both interval-based and contact-based contact data, you need to add a separate integration and write a separate SQL query for each.

### Columns required in SQL query

The following table gives you an overview of the columns required in the SQL query:

| timestamp   | Datetime  | Yes      | Start of the interval in the format YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss                                                                                                                                                  |
| offered     | Integer   | Yes      | Amount of contacts (e.g calls or emails) in the interval                                                                                                                                                 |
| handled     | Integer   | Yes      | interval-based: Amount of contacts that have been handled in the interval<br>contact-based: The value 1 indicates that the contact has been handled. The value 0 indicates that it has not been handled. |

#### Basic sample queries

Interval-based contact data:

```sql
SELECT
   queue, timestamp,
   offered, handled, aht,
   channel
FROM uploaded_file
```

Contact-based contact data:

```sql
SELECT
   queue, timestamp,
   offered, handled, duration,
   channel
FROM uploaded_file
```

The following advanced examples show how to apply mathematical operations and SQLite functions.

#### Advanced sample query 1

- Divide HandleTime by HandledCalls for the required average handling time (AHT).
- Combine Date and Time using SUBSTR for the required YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS timestamp format.

|   Queue    |    Date    | Time  | Received | HandledCalls | Aband | HandleTime | HoldTime |
| :--------: | :--------: | :---: | :------: | :----------: | :---: | :--------: | :------: |
| test queue | 06/03/2023 | 07:30 |    5     |      5       |   -   |   1324.6   |    -     |
| test queue | 06/03/2023 | 08:00 |    2     |      2       |   -   |    1548    |    -     |

```
SELECT
  Queue as queue,
  SUBSTR(Date, 7, 4) || '-'|| SUBSTR(Date, 1, 2) || '-' || SUBSTR(Date, 4,2) || ' ' || Time || ':00' as timestamp,
  Received as offered,
  HandledCalls as handled,
  HandleTime/HandledCalls as aht,
  'chats' as channel
FROM uploaded_file
```

#### Advanced sample query 2

- Use SQLite's `date('now')` to get the current date and combine this with the time from the file.
- Strip decimals and convert them to integers.
- Combine Date and Time using SUBSTR for the required YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS timestamp format.

In this example, the column headers contain blank characters.

| Queue Name | Hour in hh:mm | Offered Calls | Handled Calls | Average Handling Time |
| :--------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-------------------: |
| demo queue |     07:00     |      3.4      |      2.9      |       00:05:30        |
| demo queue |     08:30     |      5.7      |      5.2      |       00:10:15        |

You can replace the header row by using the Preprocessing options of the integration:

- Skip first 1 row(s): Removes the original header
- Add header row: Adds column headers with letters

```
 SELECT
   A as queue,
   DATE('now')||' '|| B || ':00' as timestamp,
   FLOOR(C) as offered,
   FLOOR (D) as handled,
   (CAST(substr(E, 1, 1) AS INTEGER) * 3600) +
   (CAST(substr(E, 3, 2) AS INTEGER) * 60) +
   CAST(substr(E, 6, 2) AS INTEGER) as aht,
   'calls' as channel
FROM uploaded_file
```

If you do not replace the header row, refer to the actual column names using double quotes:

```
 SELECT
   "Queue Name" as queue,
   DATE('now')||' '|| "Hour in hh:mm" || ':00' as timestamp,
   FLOOR("Offered Calls") as offered,
   FLOOR ("Handled Calls") as handled,
   (CAST(substr("Average Handling Time", 1, 1) AS INTEGER) * 3600) +
   (CAST(substr("Average Handling Time", 3, 2) AS INTEGER) * 60) +
   CAST(substr("Average Handling Time", 6, 2) AS INTEGER) as aht,
   'calls' as channel
FROM uploaded_file
```

#### Advanced sample query 3

- Calculate the handled calls by subtracting AbandonedCalls from OfferedCalls.
- Transform the special formatted Start string into the required YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS timestamp format.

|  Name  |       Start       | OfferedCalls | AbandonedCalls | AverageHandlingTime |
| :----: | :---------------: | :----------: | :------------: | :-----------------: |
| queue1 | 20230613 15:30:00 |      10      |       2        |         300         |
| queue2 | 20230613 15:35:00 |      15      |       3        |         450         |
| queue3 | 20230613 15:40:00 |      12      |       2        |         350         |

<!-- notes for database integrations -->
<!-- In this example, the date time format in the Start column is not supported by built-in SQLite `datetime()` and `strftime()` functions. You need to change the string first. -->
<!-- changed the example from datetime(substr(Start, 1, 4) || '-' || to substr(Start, 1, 4) || '-' || -->
<!-- `datetime` is not required here, but in database integrations it would be needed due to the reqiured datetime datatype in the table around line 210 -->

```
SELECT
  Name as queue,
    substr(Start, 1, 4) || '-' ||
    substr(Start, 5, 2) || '-' ||
    substr(Start, 7, 2) || ' ' ||
    substr(Start, 10, 8) as timestamp,
  Offered as offered,
  (Offered - Abandoned) as handled,
  AverageHandlingTime as aht,
  'calls' as channel
FROM uploaded_file
```

#### Advanced sample query 4

Contact-based data records often do not have a column with the number of offered and handled calls. Instead, you will see boolean values for the type of contact:

|      Queue       |   DateTimeISO8601   | Offered | Answered | Duration |
| :--------------: | :-----------------: | :-----: | :------: | :------: |
| My Inbound Queue | 2023-01-01T22:59:00 |  true   |   true   |   100    |
| My Inbound Queue | 2023-01-01T23:59:00 |  true   |  false   |   100    |

- Use a CASE statement for contact-based data with boolean values for offered and handled calls.
- Transform an ISO8601 formatted date into the required YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format.

```
SELECT
   "Queue" as queue,
   substr("DateTimeISO8601", 1, 10) || ' ' || substr("DateTimeISO8601", 12, 8) as timestamp,
   (CASE WHEN "Offered" = 'true' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as offered,
   (CASE WHEN "Answered" = 'true' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as handled,
   "Duration" as duration,
   'calls' as channel
FROM uploaded_file
```

This query will also work for real ISO8601 timestamps, such as data in UTC (2023-01-01T22:59:00Z) or timestamps with the offset of your time zone (2023-01-01T22:59:00+02:00)

<!-- do not change the heading, used in the integrations UI -->

## Import CSV files

Once you saved your CSV integration, you can start importing CSV files.
The following file encodings are supported:

- UTF-8
- ISO-8859-1/Latin-1
- ISO-8859-9
- Windows-1252

Use UTF-8 to avoid generic error messages.

### Automatic file import

[Configure a CSV integration](#configure-a-new-csv-integration) and connect injixo Cloud Link. injixo Cloud Link will periodically upload new data to injixo by looking for CSV files in its installation directory. You can change the default installation directory (C:\Program Files\injixo Cloud Link) during the installation.

Alternatively, configure a separate {% link_new import folder | features/acd-integration/cloud/install-cloud-link.md | #configure-import-folder %} for file uploads. Save the new files in the import folder instead.

After data has been uploaded, you can {% link_new add new queues to a workload | features/forecast/injixo-forecast/create-workloads.md %} in Forecast, or you will see updated data in your existing workloads. If no data is uploaded, use the manual file import described below to check if your file format is valid.

### Manual file import

You can manually upload data to injixo using a web page.

Once you have [added a CSV integration](#configure-a-new-csv-integration), you can upload data manually (you can skip the injixo Cloud Link installation).

1. Go to [https://www.injixo.com/csv-importer](https://www.injixo.com/csv-importer).
2. Click the **open your file explorer** link and select a CSV file to import (or drag & drop it into the browser).
3. In the bottom-left drop-down menu, select your CSV integration.
4. Click _Import file_{:.doc-button}.
   To avoid error messages, the file format must match the [CSV schema](#create-a-csv-schema).
5. To upload the data, click _Apply data_{:.doc-button}.

After your data has been processed, you can {% link_new add the queues to a workload | features/forecast/injixo-forecast/create-workloads.md %} in injixo Forecast. The maximum file size is 7 MB.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Can I import the same file twice?                                         | Yes, if you import data manually. No, if you are using Cloud Link. To detect duplicate files, injixo calculates checksums during the import. Imported files with the same checksum will not be imported again. However, if the file has the same name but different content, the checksum will change and the file will be imported again. |
| Will injixo delete the automatically imported CSV files after the import? | No. Imported files will remain in the injixo Cloud Link client directory. You can manually delete them or set up a recurring task yourself.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Can I import a CSV file that contains future data?                        | Yes, it is possible. However, keep in mind that injixo will not skip future data, but will store it as historical data. You can still calculate a forecast, but the graphs for history and forecast will overlap.                                                                                                                          |
