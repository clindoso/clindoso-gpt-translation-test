If you want to use historical data generated by an external source, such as an external application or by your clients, you can import external forecasts into injixo Forecast.

## Prepare the import

### Prerequisites

To import a forecast, you need at least:

- An {% link_new integration | features/acd-integration/cloud/how-integrations-work.md %} that imports data
- A workload with a {% link_new queue | features/forecast/injixo-forecast/manage-workloads.md | #queues-and-channels %}
 
### Create a queue

To create a queue, you need to import historical contact data using an integration. Queues are automatically created by integrations.

If you do not have an integration that continuously imports historical data, create a queue by importing a simple CSV file:

1. {% link_new Create a CSV integration | features/acd-integration/cloud/add-csv-integration.md | #configure-a-new-csv-integration %}.
   - Skip the Cloud Link installation step.
   - In the **CSV schema configuration** section, select **Contact data**.
2. Create a CSV file for contact data with at least one row for a single interval, e.g.:
   ```
   Queue;Date;Time;IncomingCalls;AnsweredCalls;AHT
   ForecastImportQueue;22/02/2022;02:02;2;2;2
   ```
3. {% link_new Manually import the CSV file | features/acd-integration/cloud/add-csv-integration.md | #manual-file-import %}.  
   The queue is created after the import.
   Use this queue to import forecasts into all your workloads.

### Assign the queue to a workload

When you create a workload, you need to assign a queue to it. This is an integral part of the creation process and a prerequisite to [import a forecast](#import-a-forecast). Learn more about how to {% link_new create a workload | features/forecast/injixo-forecast/manage-workloads.md | #create-workloads %}.

You can import a forecast into an existing workload, or add any of your queues to a new workload.

### Import data requirements

Your import data must match the following requirements:

| Requirement                          | Details                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Timestamp format                     | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM                                                                                                                   |
| Volume data                          | Whole numbers (integers)                                                                                                           |
| AHT data                             | Whole numbers (integers) or decimal values (with a decimal point)                                                                  |
| Header row format                   | `Timestamp;Offered;AHT` or with custom text (e.g., `Timestamp;Offered_customtext;AHT_customtext`).                                 |
| Separator characters                 | Semicolon or comma (auto-detected)                                                                                                 |
| Maximum file size                    | 20 MB<br>Keep files under 20,000&nbsp;rows (recommended).                                                                         |
| Time zone                            | Must match the time zone of the queue.                                                                                             |
| Interval length                      | Must match the interval length of the queue (15, 30, or 60 minutes).                                                               |


Alternatively, you can {% link_new download a forecast (or a forecast version) | features/forecast/injixo-forecast/download-forecast.md %} in CSV format and use it as a template for your own import file. The forecast only reads the `Timestamp`, `Offered`, and `AHT` columns. Other columns, such as `Offered_operational` and `AHT_operational` in the example below, are ignored.

```
Timestamp;Offered_auto;AHT_auto;Offered_operational;AHT_operational
2020-05-17 16:30;40;180;50;170
```

### Handle import data gaps

There can be intervals with no data in your import files. The resulting volume or AHT graph will only show imported values as zero (0). Empty rows or values will not be imported.

If there is no data for one or more intervals, you can edit your CSV file as follows:

- Leave volume and AHT blank:

  ```
  Timestamp;Offered;AHT
  2020-05-17 15:00;30;210
  2020-05-17 15:15;;
  2020-05-17 15:30;40;180
  ```

- Import columns filled with zeros:

  ```
  Timestamp;Offered;AHT
  2020-05-17 15:00;30;210
  2020-05-17 15:15;0;0
  2020-05-17 15:30;40;180
  ```

- Leave out the entire row:

  ```
  Timestamp;Offered;AHT
  2020-05-17 15:00;30;210
  2020-05-17 15:30;40;180
  ```
