With validity periods, you can set a configuration for a limited amount of time. You can program configuration changes to automatically occur in the future without further manual input.

Validity periods are always optional. If you do not specify a validity period, the configuration will be effective immediately and will not change until you manually edit it.

Validity periods are available in _WFM > Administration > Scheduling_{:.breadcrumbs}.

## Use validity periods

You can set a validity period when creating configuration data. 

Example: You want one planning unit to temporarily take over the Calls activity to avoid overloading your other planning units. You can add the Calls activity to a second planning unit and define the validity period for this configuration:

1. Go to **Planning units**.
2. Select the planning unit to which you want to add the activity.
3. Go to the **Activities** section on the right.
4. Click the {% icon item-add %}.
5. Enter a **Valid from** and **Valid to** date. This is the validity period.
6. Choose the activity and set **From** and **To** hours.
7. Click _OK_{:.doc-button}.

## Edit a validity period

You can also edit the validity period for existing configuration data. 

Example: You want to extend the contract for a certain person. You can edit the validity period of the person's contract:

1. Go to **Employees**.
2. Select the employee whose contract you want to extend.
3. Go to the **Contracts** section on the right.
4. Click the {% icon item-edit %} next to the contract you want to extend.
5. Edit the **Valid to** field.
6. Click _OK_{:.doc-button}.
