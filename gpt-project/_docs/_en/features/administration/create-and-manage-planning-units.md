Planning units group people and configuration data for scheduling purposes. Your business locations do not necessarily have to correspond to your planning units. For example, people who work at two different locations can be {% link_new assigned | features/administration/employee-overview.md | #configure-employee-settings %} to one planning unit.

## How many planning units should I use?

To minimize efforts, you can schedule people who work in different locations or teams in one planning unit by using {% link_new selections | features/administration/selections.md %}. We recommend using more than one planning unit in the following cases:

- People work in different time zones.
- Planners are only responsible for groups of people, e.g. business units. In injixo Advanced and Enterprise WFM, custom user roles can {% link_new restrict access to planning units | getting-started/configure-user-roles.md | #manage-team-access-restrict-access-to-configuration-data %}.
- You have shared staff requirements, e.g. for overflow scenarios.
- You want to create reports that include the total numbers from several planning units.

> Tips for working with multiple planning units
>
> - To group figures across planning units, add a parent planning unit to all relevant planning units.
> - You can temporarily change an employeeâ€™s assignment from one planning unit to another.<br>Learn more about how to {% link_new delegate employees | features/administration/employee-overview.md | #delegate-employees %}.

<!-- Typically, you assign one planning unit to a person at a time. Reassign a planning unit using valid from and valid to dates in the employee configuration. In rare cases, you will need to assign more than one planning unit to a person. The person's main planning unit is assigned with priority 1. The person is scheduled in this main planning unit. A person's schedule will be displayed in other planning units with lower priority. You can also manually reschedule people in other planning units if needed. -->

## Create planning units

1. Go to _Plan > Configuration > Planning Units_{:.breadcrumbs}.
2. Click the New icon {% icon item-add | icon-only %} in the upper left.  
   A configuration panel opens on the right side.
3. Complete the following fields:

   - **Name**: Unique name for the planning unit (max. 50 characters).
   - **Abbreviation**: Abbreviation for the name (max. 25 characters).
   - **Color**: Optional color for the planning unit. You will see the color in Schedules.
   - **Interval**: Influences the level of detail in which data is displayed in Schedules, e.g. coverage and staff requirements. The planning unit interval should not be longer than the interval of your contact and agent status data imports. The drop-down menu shows planning unit intervals in minutes. We recommend using **15&nbsp;minutes**. The interval cannot be changed after saving. Learn more about {% link_new data imports through integrations | features/acd-integration/cloud/how-integrations-work.md %}.
   - **Parent Planning Unit**: Optional planning unit that contains the planning unit you are creating. Learn more about {% link_new parent planning units | best-practices/how-to-use-virtual-planning-units.md %}.
   - **Time Zone**: Time zone of the planning unit. The time zone cannot be changed after saving the planning unit. Learn more about {% link_new working with time zones | best-practices/working-with-timezones.md %}.

     > Note
     >
     > The selected time zone must match the time zone of your workloads in Forecast. Otherwise, you cannot transfer staff requirements for scheduling. An integration will adjust the imported data according to the time zone of your workloads.

4. Click _Ok_{:.doc-button}.  
   You can now add business hours, activities, or {% link_new limit day models | features/administration/create-and-manage-planning-units.md | #limit-day-models %}.

### Add business hours

To add business hours to a planning unit, {% link_new create the planning unit first | features/administration/create-and-manage-planning-units.md | #create-planning-units %}.

For scheduling, you need to add business hours to the day types included in the planning unit. Business hours limit the daily hours for which you can {% link_new calculate staff requirements | features/forecast/injixo-forecast/calculate-staff-requirements.md %} and {% link_new create optimized schedules | features/scheduling/schedules/schedules-optimized-schedules.md %}. <!-- special public holiday day types or part of the linked article? -->

1. In the **Business Hours** section of the planning unit configuration panel, click the {% icon item-add %}.  
   A dialog window opens.
2. In the **Day Types** section, select one or more {% link_new day types | features/administration/day-types.md %}.
3. Enter the start and end time in the **From** and **To** fields (24&nbsp;hours format). If you are open 24&nbsp;hours, enter 00:00 in both fields.
4. (Optional) In the **Valid from** and **Valid to** fields, enter a date range that the business hours apply to. If the business hours always apply, leave the fields blank. Learn more about {% link_new validity periods | features/administration/set-a-validity-period.md %}.
5. Click _Ok_{:.doc-button}.

To modify or remove business hours, click the {% icon item-edit %} or the {% icon item-delete %}.

### Add activities

To add activities to a planning unit, you need to {% link_new create the planning unit first | features/administration/create-and-manage-planning-units.md | #create-planning-units %}.

Before you create schedules, you need to add all relevant activities of type Presence to planning units. You can only schedule people for activities that you have added to their planning unit. By default, all planning units include the Present activity, which cannot be deleted.
To include activities of any type in your reports, add the activities to the relevant planning units.

To add activities to a planning unit, proceed as follows:

1. In the **Activities** section of the planning unit configuration panel, click the {% icon item-add %}.  
   A dialog window opens.
2. Click the activity you want to add.
3. Enter a time range in the **From** and **To** fields. The {% link_new Create optimized schedules | features/scheduling/schedules/schedules-optimized-schedules.md %} functionality will consider this activity within the time range you entered. When both fields have the value 00:00, injixo considers the business hours of the planning unit. Users with admin access can change this default behavior in setting _48408_{:.id-label} _Take into account business hours in AutoScheduler_.
4. (Optional) Enter a date range in the **Valid from** and **Valid to** fields to limit when the activity is available for scheduling.<br>Leave the **Valid from** and **Valid to** fields blank to make it always available.
5. Click _Ok_{:.doc-button}.

To edit or delete an activity, click the {% icon item-edit %} or the {% icon item-delete %}.

### Add multiactivities

To add a {% link_new multiactivity | features/administration/activity-types-and-properties.md | #subactivities %} to a planning unit, you need to add all the respective subactivities first. The multiactivity appears in bold in the list of activities. Multiactivities are not available in injixo Essential WFM.

### Limit day models

By default, all {% link_new day models | features/administration/daymodels/daymodel-creation.md %} are assigned to your planning units. If you do not use all day models in a planning unit, you can limit the number of day models for that planning unit.

Limiting day models can speed up scheduling with the Create optimized schedules functionality. However, you can only use day models that are assigned to the planning unit to generate shifts, create reports, or create optimized schedules. This may involve more effort in maintaining the other configuration data, e.g. week time patterns. Deleting a day model in use does not affect the schedules and shifts created with that day model.

> Note
>
> If you delete all day models in the planning unit, you can only schedule activities manually or by {% link_new inserting activities in shift sequences | features/administration/shift-sequences.md %}. You can no longer use the **Create optimized schedule** functionality.

To limit the number of day models, proceed as follows:

1. Go to _Plan > Configuration > Planning Units_{:.breadcrumbs}.
2. Select the planning unit you want to edit and scroll to the **Day Models** section of the configuration panel.
3. To limit the number of day models, replace or delete the default day model assignment:
   - Click the {% icon item-edit %} next to the **[All]** option and select a day model.
   - Click the {% icon item-delete %} to delete the **[All]** option.
4. Click the {% icon item-add %} to assign one or more day models. You cannot add the same day model twice. To edit or delete an added day model, click the {% icon item-edit %} or the {% icon item-delete %}.
5. Click _Ok_{:.doc-button}.

## Delete planning units

> Warning
>
> If you delete a planning unit, you can no longer access the corresponding schedules.

1. Go to _Plan > Configuration > Planning units_{:.breadcrumbs}.
2. Select the planning unit you want to delete.
3. Click the {% icon item-delete %} in the upper left.
4. To confirm, click _Yes_{:.doc-button}.
