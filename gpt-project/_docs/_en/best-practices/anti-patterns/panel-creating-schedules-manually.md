...rather than inserting Shift Sequences

#### Did you know...?

It's easy to get into the habit of adding shifts or day models manually rather than creating a shift sequence. But did you know that you can use the same Shift Sequence for multiple employees?

Building the Shift Sequences might seem like a chore, but if you are spending 30 minutes per week copying and pasting schedules for half your Employees, thats 26 hours per year. You can cut down this time with a few simple steps.

#### What you should do is...?

**Check if the Employees can use a Shift Sequence you have already created** - See your current Shift Sequences: Can you use one of them for an employee you copy and paste? Start the employees on another week by offsetting the start date.

**Can you use a Week and Work Time Pattern?** - Work time patterns can save you time. See the video below which gives you a quick tour of how to set up a work time pattern. See the article on {% link_new Work time pattern models | features/administration/work-time-pattern-models.md %}. In injixo Essential WFM, work time pattern models are not available.

**Copy using Scheduling Actions in Schedules** - If it is necessary to copy schedules, use the {% link_new copy level content | features/scheduling/schedules/schedules-copy-level-content.md %} function. This works for specific employees or a selection of employees. There is no need to copy the schedule of all agents.

**Tip:** You can set 'Exception Days' in your _Week Time Patterns_ for more flexibility.
