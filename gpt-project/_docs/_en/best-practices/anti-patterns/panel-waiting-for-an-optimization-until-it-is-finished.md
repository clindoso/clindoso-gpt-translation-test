...when you forgot to do something

#### Did you know...?

Optimizations are jobs. When you start one, you can see its progress in _Administration > System > JobProcessor_{:.breadcrumbs}. A quicker option is to restart a job which has not been completed.

#### What you should do is...?

You can stop your full optimization run if you realize part way through that you need to repeat it anyway once it is finished, e.g. if you missed inserting your shift sequences. Use the _JobProcessor_ overview and abort the job before it actually finishes.

**Tip:**
You can Cancel, Delete or Re-submit jobs via the JobProcessor.
