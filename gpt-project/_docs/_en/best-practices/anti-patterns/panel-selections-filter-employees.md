...rather than using Employee Filters.

#### Did you know...?

Selections are not the only way to filter employees. Rather than creating selections and assigning them one-by-one to Employees, you can create filters. Employee filters are a powerful method to filter staffs by skills, contract, selection, attributes, employee categories or a combination.

#### What you should do is...?

Why not create an employee filter <!-- [employee filter](https://help.injixo.com/de/employee-filter/) --> <!-- , article not available in EN? --> to get the list of employees you want to edit. Then you can use the mass update <!-- [mass update functionality](https://help.injixo.com/de/mass-update/) --> <!-- article not available in EN? --> to update the selected employees.

**Tip:** Create a filter with multiple 'queries' such as which Planning Unit they are in, which Skill they have, and which Contract you have assigned.
