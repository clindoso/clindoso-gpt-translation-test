## Home working for contact center employees

More and more contact centers are offering home working as an option for their agents. The coronavirus pandemic and the stay at home orders imposed by governments around the world have accelerated this trend and taught us some new lessons. This is one of those moments where planners (and their WFM partners) can make a real difference to contact center effectiveness and efficiency in the face of adversity.

Here are some top tips from the injixo team:

## General scheduling tips

- Implement {% link_new Split Shifts | best-practices/scheduling-split-shifts.md %}, which allow agents to have extended breaks to cover childcare.
- Use {% link_new Shift Bidding | features/scheduling/schedules/schedules-shift-bidding.md %} to generate shifts and allow agents to bid on them; Publish a shift window to cover shortfall gaps.

## injixo-specific scheduling tips

All of the ‘general’ tips above are supported by injixo, plus the following:

- Give Team Leaders access to {% link_new Schedules | features/scheduling/schedules/schedules-overview.md %} to view agent shifts.
- Make it easy for Planners to see Agents that are working from home using {% link_new Day Status | best-practices/visualizing-home-office.md %}
- Allow agents to set their Availability within {% link_new injixo Me | features/injixo-me/use-injixo-me/explore-injixo-me.md %} and schedule around that.
- Use ‘What If’ scenarios, e.g. using the Actual schedule level.
- Use {% link_new Selections | features/scheduling/shiftcenter/shift-center-overview.md %} to filter your Home Workers.
- Use comments in {% link_new Shift Center | features/scheduling/shiftcenter/shift-center-overview.md %} to add important information that you would like to be visible to your agents.
- Agents should request absences using injixo Me {% link_new injixo Me | features/injixo-me/use-injixo-me/explore-injixo-me.md %}.

## Useful reports

With a lowered level of visibility when staff are not working in the office, it is important to monitor and track attendance and absences. For this case we suggest some reports you can use to cope with this challenge.

### Illness statistics with total amount column

Use that report to create an overview for Planning Units, which informs you of the total of all assigned paid and unpaid illnesses of each Employee in hours and days, both overall and per illness. In addition, injixo shows the total number of absent employees, standardized to a full-time Employee (full-time equivalent).

### Activities in hours

Use this report to create an overview with hourly values for the employees' paid working time. Select Activities to display the hourly shares (total and individual). You can filter this report to display only those Activities that are of the type `Illness` or `Absence` to more easily calculate shrinkage.

### Absence statistics

Use this report to create a monthly overview for Planning Units, that informs you of the total of all paid and unpaid absences assigned to each employee in hours and days for each absence.

### Absence schedule

Use this report to create a monthly overview, broken down by Planning Units, that informs you of the total hours of each employee's assigned paid and unpaid absences.

### General absence schedule

Use this report to create general absence schedules for Planning Units, which shows you an overview, broken down by Planning Units, that informs you of the total hours of all assigned paid and unpaid non-presences for each employee.
