Your organization is billed according to our [terms and conditions](https://www.injixo.com/en-de/terms-and-conditions).

injixo counts all {% link_new accounts you create | getting-started/manage-user-accounts.md %} under:

- **People**
- _Plan > Configuration > Employees_{:.breadcrumbs}
- _Account > Users_{:.breadcrumbs}

The three sections listed above display all people, but each person only counts once for billing.
The creation date for new people is the start date of the staff membership you set when you {% link_new create a new person | features/people/configure-people.md | #create-a-person %} in _People_{:.breadcrumbs}. Changing that date in _Plan > Configuration > Employees_{:.breadcrumbs} does not change the people count and billing for the first month.

## Manage your billing information

> Only people with admin access or with the default Finance role can access _Account > Billing_{:.breadcrumbs}.
>
> If you need access, contact your admin.

Go to _Account > Billing_{:.breadcrumbs} to access your organization's billing information. Here, you can:

- Check your current people count
- Manage invoice recipients
- Download invoices

### Check your current people count

To get an overview of licensed people in your injixo tenant for the current and previous months, proceed as follows:

1. Click _Subscription_{:.menu-item}.  
   The **Your Current Subscription** section displays a table with the total people count for the current month.
2. In the **History** section, select the **month** and **year** to populate a graph in the **User Count** section.

Note: Your invoice will include the people count as a line item.

### Manage invoice recipients

Click _Contacts_{:.menu-item} to see the current invoice recipients' email addresses. The listed invoice recipients will receive the monthly invoices and reminders.

To change the invoice recipients, contact our finance team at finance@ivx.com.
