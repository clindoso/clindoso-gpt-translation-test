Your organization is billed according to your [WFM plan](https://www.injixo.com/pricing) and number of users:
- In injixo Essential, Advanced, and Enterprise WFM, the billing calculation includes a monthly [base fee with a fixed number of users](https://www.injixo.com/pricing). Your organization will be invoiced for any additional active users.
- In injixo Classic, your organization is billed per created user.

Your invoice at the end of the month is based on the highest daily user count of that month, minus the number of users included in your planâ€™s base fee.

injixo counts all {% link_new user accounts you create | getting-started/manage-user-accounts.md %} under:

- _WFM > Administration > Scheduling > Employees_{:.breadcrumbs}
- _Account > Users_{:.breadcrumbs}
- **People**

The three sections listed above will display all your users, but each user only counts once for billing.

New users are counted and billed at the end of the month.
The creation date for new users is the Join date in WFM > Administration > Scheduling > Employees. Changing the join date does not change the user count and billing for the first month.

## View billed and unbilled users

Go to _Account > Users_{:.breadcrumbs} to see a complete overview of all users, divided into two tabs:

- Billed users: This tab shows all active users in your injixo tenant.
- Unbilled users: This tab shows all {% link_new deactivated users | features/administration/deactivate-employees.md %} who can no longer log in to injixo. Your organization is no longer billed for deactivated users.
  
## Remove users from billing

To remove users from billing, {% link_new deactivate or delete them | features/administration/deactivate-employees.md %} from injixo.
