Your organization is billed according to our [terms and conditions](https://www.injixo.com/en-de/terms-and-conditions).

injixo counts all {% link_new user accounts you create | getting-started/manage-user-accounts.md %} under:

- _Plan > Configuration > Employees_{:.breadcrumbs}
- _Account > Users_{:.breadcrumbs}
- **People**

The three sections listed above will display all your users, but each user only counts once for billing.

The creation date for new users is the join date in _Plan > Configuration > Employees_{:.breadcrumbs}. Changing the join date does not change the user count and billing for the first month.

## View billed and unbilled users

Go to _Account > Users_{:.breadcrumbs} to see a complete overview of all users, divided into two tabs:

- Billed users: This tab shows all active users in your injixo tenant.
- Unbilled users: This tab shows all {% link_new deactivated users | features/administration/deactivate-employees.md %} who can no longer log in to injixo. Your organization is no longer billed for deactivated users.
  
## Remove users from billing

To remove users from billing, {% link_new deactivate or delete them | features/administration/deactivate-employees.md %} from injixo.

## Manage your billing information

> Only users with admin access or with the default Finance role can access _Account > Billing_{:.breadcrumbs}.
>
> If you need access, contact your admin.

Go to _Account > Billing_{:.breadcrumbs} to access your organization's billing information. Here, you can:

 - Check your current user count
 - Manage invoice recipients
 - Download invoices

### Check your current user count

To get an overview of licensed users in your injixo account for the current and previous months, proceed as follows:

1. Click _Subscription_{:.menu-item}.  
    The **Your Current Subscription** section displays a table with the total user count for the current month.
2. In the **History** section, select the **month** and **year** to populate a graph in the **User Count** section.

Note: Your invoice will include the user count as a line item.

### Manage invoice recipients

Click _Contacts_{:.menu-item} to see the current invoice recipients' email addresses. The listed invoice recipients will receive the monthly invoices and reminders.

To change the invoice recipients, contact our finance team at finance@ivx.com.

> Late invoice payment may result in the suspension of your injixo service. 
> 
> We recommend providing at least two invoice recipients.
