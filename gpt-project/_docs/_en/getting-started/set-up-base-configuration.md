Before you can start scheduling, you need to set up the basic configuration in injixo. Some of the basic configuration items are strictly required by injixo to create a schedule while others are optional, depending on the {% link_new scheduling methods | features/scheduling/scheduling-methods.md %} you want to use.

## Configuration order

We recommend setting up the configuration items in the order presented in the next section. Configuration items have interdependencies and can be assigned to one another. Follow the links in the table to learn more about each configuration item and how to configure them. 
No configuration setup is the same, which is why the optimal order might be different for your organization. Use this article as a checklist to support your onboarding. Contact your consultant if you have any questions.

### Required configuration elements

The table below gives an overview of the required configuration items you need to configure in injixo, regardless of the scheduling method you want to use.
