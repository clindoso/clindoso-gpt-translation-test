## What is Academy?

Academy is a self-service learning platform that helps you use injixo or train your employees on injixo Me. To get the most out of injixo, you can access our library of microlearning training materials (e.g. videos, e-learning, and downloadable slides).

## How can I access Academy?

To access Academy, click _![graduation hat icon](/assets/img/common/academic_cap.png)_{:.doc-button-icon} in the upper right. Academy will open in a new tab.

### User limit

Within your organization, up to 25 injixo users can use Academy per month. At the beginning of every month, the user limit resets. The same 25 users or different users can access Academy.

### User role restriction

There are different {% link_new user roles | getting-started/configure-user-roles.md %} in injixo, organized by role categories. By default, all users with a user role from the role categories _Planner_, _Supervisor (advanced)_, _Supervisor (basic)_, and _Trainer_ can access Academy. Users with _Admin access_ can adjust user roles under _Account > User roles_{:.breadcrumbs} and configure access to Academy in the _Permissions_ section.

## How can I use Academy?

There are three ways to find the training you need:

### Train yourself

The first five training topics consist of self-paced learning plans. Each learning plan includes several courses with e-learning and/or video content.

We recommend sharing the training materials with your employees directly in Academy by presenting your screen while you walk them through. You can also download the resources to use offline.

### All courses

To find all courses available in Academy, click _Go to all courses_{:.doc-button}. The courses are organized in catalogs by the top-level navigation items in injixo. To view all courses in a catalog, use the carousel function with the two arrows or click the catalog title (e.g. Plan).
