Are you experiencing an issue or need additional support? Your injixo support team is happy to assist. Instructions on how to submit a support request are below.

Please include only one issue or question per support request. The more information you provide, the faster we can analyze and resolve the issue.

The answers to the following questions will help us:

- Can you currently use injixo?
- Are you seeing an error message, and if so, what is it?
- How many users are affected? One, several or all?
- Have there been any recent server, network, or configuration changes?

Provide a brief description of the issue or question. We appreciate screenshots!

1. If you haven't already done so, do a quick search in the Help Center. We have a lot of great information!
2. If you still need our help, click **Raise a support ticket** on the [Help Center landing page]({{ site.url }}).
3. Follow the instructions on the screen and fill out all fields. If your issue is urgent, you may indicate that you would like someone to call you and provide your contact information. Once complete, click _Submit_{:.doc-button}.

## Log files in injixo Enterprise on-premise

In injixo Enterprise on-premise, we cannot access the log files, which might be required to perform a problem analysis.

Save the log files before a potential server restart. You can find the required log files in the installation directory on the server; by default in `C:\Program Files\injixo Enterprise Server\Server` or `C:\Program Files\InVision Enterprise WFM\Server`. You can identify them by `.log` or `.lo#` file extensions. Primarily, save the Enterprise Server log files `ies64.log` and `ies64.lo#`.
