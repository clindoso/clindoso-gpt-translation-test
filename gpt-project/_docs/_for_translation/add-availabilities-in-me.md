In _Me > Availability_{:.breadcrumbs}, you can view your current availabilities and manage your one-time availabilities. You can view both your weekly and one-time availabilities, but you can only add, edit and delete one-time availabilities. For example, if your availability deviates from your weekly availabilities on a certain date, you can add a one-time availability in injixo Me.

You cannot add, edit or delete availabilities if the date is grayed out on the availability configuration page. If you still need to add or edit your availability on this date, contact your planner.
