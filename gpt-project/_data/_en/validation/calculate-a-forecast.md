Based on historical data, the forecast calculates the number of employees needed to handle the incoming volumes for an activity in a planning unit.\nThis article provides an overview of the procedure of creating a forecast. To learn more about the details of each step, follow the links in this article.\n\nUse this article as a checklist to support your onboarding. Contact your consultant if you have any questions.\n\n## Prerequisite\n\nBefore you create a schedule, make sure you have correctly {% link_new set up your base configuration | getting-started/set-up-base-configuration.md %}.\n## 1. Set up an integration\n\nUnder _Account > Integrations_{:.breadcrumbs}, set up an {% link_new integration | features/acd-integration/cloud/how-integrations-work.md %} with your external system to upload historical data. The integration will upload data to injixo and create queues.\n\n## 2. Set up a workload\n\nUnder _Forecast_{:.breadcrumbs}, create {% link_new a workload from the queues created by your integration | features/forecast/injixo-forecast/manage-workloads.md %}. A forecast will be generated within minutes.\n\nNote: To {% link_new import external forecasts | features/forecast/injixo-forecast/import-forecast.md %} you must select at least one queue. If no queue is present, you must upload at least one data point using a {% link_new CSV integration | features/acd-integration/cloud/add-csv-integration.md %}.\n\n## 3. Create and add events\n\nCreate all {% link_new events | features/forecast/injixo-forecast/events-and-holidays.md %} that might influence your forecast calculation. Add the created events to the history and forecast within your workload(s) to improve the calculation result.\n\n## 4. Save a forecast version\n\nA {% link_new forecast version | features/forecast/injixo-forecast/store-forecast-versions.md %} is a snapshot of the current calculation result. Save the forecast version for later review or to compare your forecast with the volume on the actual day, e.g. in {% link_new Dashboards | features/monitoring/dashboards/dashboards-overview.md %}.\n\n## 5. Calculate staff requirements\n\nTo create optimized schedules or run the job optimization, you must first {% link_new calculate the staff requirements | features/forecast/injixo-forecast/staff-requirement.md %} for the corresponding activities within your workloads.\n\n\n## What's next?\n\nYou've done it! You are now ready to {% link_new create your first schedule | getting-started/create-a-schedule.md %} based on your forecast and staff requirements.\n
