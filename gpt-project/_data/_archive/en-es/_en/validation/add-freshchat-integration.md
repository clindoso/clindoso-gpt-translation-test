Follow the process as described in {% link_new Add a cloud integration | features/acd-integration/cloud/add-cloud-integration.md %}:\n\n1. Go to _Account > Integrations_{:.breadcrumbs}.\n2. If there already is an integration, click _Add integration_{:.doc-button}.\n3. In the **Freshworks** tile, click _Select model_{:.doc-button}.\n4. In the **Freshchat** section, click _Add integration_{:.doc-button}.\n\n## Set up your Freshchat integration \n\n1. Enter a unique name for the new integration that identifies the data source.\n2. In the **Credentials** section, enter your full Freshchat domain name including the subdomain, e.g. example.freshchat.com.\n3. Go to Freshchat and copy a valid API key of a user with the Account Administrator role.\n4. Go back to injixo and paste the API key in the **API key** field.\n5. Click _Save integration_{:.doc-button}. \n\n### Install the injixo app\n\nThe Freshchat integration requires a client application. After you have saved your configuration, you can access the **Install the injixo app** section at the bottom of the page.\n\nGenerate and copy the **injixo API key** here.\n\nTo set up the injixo app in your Freshdesk account, follow the on-screen instructions. For more information, refer to the [Freshworks marketplace](https://www.freshworks.com/apps/freshdesk/injixo_connect).\n\n## Freshchat data in injixo\n\n### Contacts\n\nIn Freshchat, a chat usually contains multiple conversations that take place between your team members and your customers. In injixo, each solved chat counts as one contact, independent of the number of conversations.\n\nExample: A customer creates a chat on the website, the team member then responds but solves the issue one day later, due to further information needed. This would be counted as one contact in injixo.\n\n### Source queue naming convention\n\nThe source queues that injixo creates from your chats follow this convention:\n\n"group name"\n\nExamples:\n\n- Customer Support\n- Undefined_Queue\n\n### Deleted and spam chats\n\nA chat can be deleted or marked as spam when it is updated. In this case, the integration cannot determine the group name. The source queues that count such chats are labeled Undefined_Queue. Typically, these queues are irrelevant for scheduling your people's workload.\n\n
