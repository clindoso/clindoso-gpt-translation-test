You can use it for all activities your people work on and that are based on staff requirements, e.g. calls. \n\n<div class="table__wrapper" markdown="1">\n\n<style>\ntable {\n   width: 100%;\n}\n</style>\n\n| &nbsp;                                      |  Present  | Lunch break |         Illness         |  Vacation |\n| ------------------------------------------- | :---------------------: | :----------------------: | :---------------------: | :---------------------: |\n| **Type**                                        |         Presence         |          Break           |         Illness         |        Vacation         |\n| Paid                                        | <i class="fa fa-check"> |                          | <i class="fa fa-check"> | <i class="fa fa-check"> |\n| Comply with rest period                     | <i class="fa fa-check"> |                          |                         |\n| Plannable                                   | <i class="fa fa-check"> |                          |                         |\n| Requestable in Me                                 |                         | <i class="fa fa-check">  |                         | <i class="fa fa-check"> |\n| Replaceable                                 | <i class="fa fa-check"> |                          |                         |\n| Exchangeable with shift swap            | <i class="fa fa-check"> | <i class="fa fa-check">  |                         |\n| Allow as full-day activity                  |                         |                          | <i class="fa fa-check"> | <i class="fa fa-check"> |\n\n</div>\n\nDepending on your organization's policy, contracts or labor regulations, some breaks may also be unpaid. In this case, uncheck the Paid checkbox.\n\n## Absences and meetings\n\nThis table covers setup examples for the activity types Absence and Meeting.\nPaid absences are typically used to compensate overtime or as a blocker to {% link_new schedule public holidays | best-practices/scheduling-public-holidays.md %}. \nIf there are days when an employee cannot work under any circumstances, you can block those days using the configuration setup under Unpaid absence.\n\n<div class="table__wrapper" markdown="1">\n\n| &nbsp;                                        | Paid absence | Unpaid absence |    Full-day meeting     |  Training  |\n| --------------------------------------------- | :-----------------------: | :-------------------------: | :---------------------: | :---------------------: |\n| **Type**                                          |          Absence          |           Absence           |         Meeting         |         Meeting         |\n| Paid                                          |  <i class="fa fa-check">  |                             | <i class="fa fa-check"> | <i class="fa fa-check"> |\n| Comply with rest period                       |                           |                             | <i class="fa fa-check"> |\n| Plannable                                     |                           |                             |                         |\n| Requestable in Me                                   |  <i class="fa fa-check">  |   <i class="fa fa-check">   |                         |\n| Replaceable                                   |                           |                             |                         |\n| Exchangeable with shift swap              |                           |                             |                         |\n| Allow as full-day activity                    |  <i class="fa fa-check">  |   <i class="fa fa-check">   |                         | <i class="fa fa-check"> |\n\n</div>\n\nYou can also use paid absences as compensation days for overtime or as paid blocker when {% link_new scheduling public holidays | best-practices/scheduling-public-holidays.md %}.<br>\nThe Unpaid Absence activity can also be used to flexibly determine on which days an employee will not work under any circumstances.
