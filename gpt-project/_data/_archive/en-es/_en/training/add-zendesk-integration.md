The average handle time (AHT) data is only available for Zendesk Talk.\n\nNew to integrations? Learn {% link_new the basics | features/acd-integration/cloud/how-integrations-work.md %} first.\n\n## Add a Zendesk integration\n\nIn your Zendesk account, create an API token for a user with [Administrative Permissions](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408843355290-Zendesk-for-Salesforce-integration-Required-profile-permissions).\n\nTo add a new Zendesk integration in injixo, follow the steps below:\n\n1. Go to _Account > Integrations_{:.breadcrumbs}.\n2. If there already is an integration, click _Add integration_{:.doc-button}.\n3. In the Zendesk tile, click _Add integration_{:.doc-button}.\n4. Enter a unique name for the new integration that identifies the data source.\n5. In the **User crendentials** section, enter your Zendesk crendentials:\n   * Enter your full Zendesk domain name including the subdomain, e.g. example.zendesk.com.\n   * Enter your Zendesk username.\n   * Enter your API token.\n6. In the **Configuration** section, select a grouping strategy. Choose either the **IVR** or the **Phone number** option. The strategy determines how injixo [names the resulting source queues](#queue-names-for-zendesk-talk) for Zendesk Talk views. The IVR option uses the destination group. The Phone number option uses the receiving number to generate the source queue name. A call without the relevant information will appear as ungrouped. Source queues for Zendesk Support are not affected.\n\n   > You cannot change the grouping strategy once you have saved the injixo integration configuration.\n\n7. Click _Save integration_{:.doc-button}.\n\n## Zendesk data in injixo\n\n### Tickets vs. contact events\n\nIn Zendesk, a ticket usually contains multiple interactions between your team members and your customers through the different communication channels.\n\nEvery interaction represents one task that your team members have to handle. An interaction can be a new ticket or a change to an existing ticket.\n\nExample: A user creates a ticket by writing an email. The team member then replies and closes the ticket. Two days later, the user sends another email replying to the team members's email, which reopens the ticket. In injixo, this would be counted as two emails, although happening on a single ticket.\n\n### Views\n\ninjixo builds source queues based on your Zendesk views. After the initial data import, you will see a source queue for every supported view that you have created in Zendesk. If a view contains events from different channels (e.g. chat and email), these will appear in separate {% link_new channels | features/forecast/injixo-forecast/manage-workloads.md | #queues-and-channels %} in injixo.\n\nNote: Adding new Zendesk views after you have saved the integration will auto-generate new injixo source queues and related history.\n\n### Unsupported views\n\ninjixo can create source queues for most views but currently does not support views that use the following ticket fields:\n\n- Business Hours\n- SLA\n- Channel\n- Skills\n- Conditions with user-specific values (e.g. Assignee is (current user))\n\nIf you have Zendesk views with conditions referring to at least one of the fields above, injixo will ignore these views and will not create queues for them.\n\n### Channel mapping between Zendesk and injixo\n\nAny change event on a Zendesk ticket may be counted within multiple injixo channels.\n\nExample: An email will create a ticket which will show up in an email queue in injixo. If that same ticket enters a chat view, it will also be counted in a chat queue in injixo.\n\n| Zendesk Channel                           | injixo       |\n| ----------------------------------------- | ------------ |\n| email                                     | email        |\n| mobile                                    | email        |\n| web                                       | email        |\n| chat                                      | chat         |\n| native_messaging                          | chat         |\n| sms                                       | social_media |\n| any_channel                               | social_media |\n| facebook                                  | social_media |\n| twitter                                   | social_media |\n| sunshine_conversations_facebook_messenger | social_media |\n| instagram_dm                              | social_media |\n| voice                                     | call         |\n| api                                       | case         |\n| answer_bot_for_web_widget                 | case         |\n| chat_transcript                           | case         |\n| mobile_sdk                                | case         |\n\n### Queue names for Zendesk Support\n\nThe resulting source queue name for Zendesk Support queues will follow this convention:\n\n"view name + (injixo channel)"\n\nExamples:\n\n- Support Tickets (chat)\n\n### Queue names for Zendesk Talk\n\nThe resulting source queue name for Zendesk Talk queues will follow this convention:\n\n"Calls Inbound For + grouping strategy"\n\nExamples:\n\n- Calls Inbound For +49123456789 (Phone number)\n- Calls Inbound For Senior Agents (IVR)\n- Calls Inbound Ungrouped\n
